DATA_SCIENCE_CONTEXT = """
Data science involves statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to extract insights from data.
Supervised learning uses labeled datasets. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Networks

Unsupervised learning includes clustering (e.g., K-Means) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).
Deep learning is a subset using multi-layer neural networks and tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm to minimize loss by updating weights.
Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize.
Cross-validation is used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
